“Maps have always been made; they may have been one of the first forms
of human communication. Maps exist in many forms, can represent
different ideas and are used for many purposes. In choosing what to
represent, how to represent it and what not to represent, maps are
expressions of power.” –Logan Cochrane, Jon Corbett and Peter Keller,
Impact of Community-based and Participatory Mapping

## <u>Course Description</u>

Spatial data is all around us, whether its survey information with zip
codes or the various landmarks that comprise what people consider their
neighborhood. While maps, like census tracts or political boundaries are
traditionally extensions of authorities of power, participatory mapping
seeks to break down those barriers. The objective of this course is to
put mapping into the hands of students so that they can transfer these
skills and frameworks to civil society.

The way COVID-19 played out in the United States underscored the
institutional problems related to health, inequality, and the
environment in the United States of America. The global crisis of
climate change reinforces the institutional racism and environmental
issues that have proliferated far beyond the U.S. national borders.
Given all these issues, more so than ever, civil society is needed to
build the coalitions and reassess priorities to usher in an era of
political change.

Mapping and data are transformative tools that strengthen these
connections between coalitions because they are representations of the
physical world around us. However, in non-profits and other fields of
civic engagement, these tools are underutilized or simply seen as tools
“left to the experts”. This course prepares students to be informed
digital citizens and transfer these tools for practical application in
civil society. The two main objectives for this course are, 1) to walk
away with technical web development skills relevant to mapping for civil
society, and 2) to apply an ethical mapping framework to such projects.

## <u>Course Objectives:</u>

-   Undertake analysis that are informed by critical data studies,
    participatory frameworks, social fieldwork, and ethical
    considerations.

-   Learn transferable technical data and mapping skills as applied
    through action-oriented, collaborative, and project-based research.

-   Learn to critically assess datasets, digital mapping/ visualization
    technologies for use in non-profits

-   Learn to create an interactive web map that uses community-based
    data from a non-profit or community-based organization

-   Perform a data needs assessment for non-profits for an interactive
    map that enhances the mission/goals of the organization

-   Learn to work in research teams in order to conceptualize, design,
    carry out, and deliver persuasive arguments through presenting a web
    site that includes a web map and other digital media.

### Remote Learning Expectations for Students

Even though remote learning has been in session for more than a year,
students are expected to be respectful of various difficulties
associated with online instruction that others may have. I hope that you
will communicate with me if you experience anything in this course that
does not support an inclusive environment. You can also report any
incidents you may witness or experience online the Office of Equity,
Diversity, and Inclusion on [their website](https://equity.ucla.edu/).
Basic Zoom protocols for this course are as follows:

-   Mute microphones when not talking

-   Feel free to use the chat to ask questions at any time

-   Ensure that your preferred name and pronouns are included in your
    Zoom name

-   Though encouraged, video cameras are optional

    -   If cameras are turned off, please provide a profile picture, this will help students and myself to identify you throughout the course 

### Lab Requirements

Lab assignments will require use of a text-based coding environment,
such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code in addition to QGIS (an open-source
desktop GIS software). Please be sure to have required software
installed prior to lab sessions. Reach out if there are any installation
issues or concerns before labs.

### Lab Assistance

While the goal in the course is to ease everyone into GIS and writing
code, I understand that the process may be intimidating and difficult.
Rest assured that your success is my success, and I will try my best in
making a learning environment that breaks down these initial barriers.
We all have gone through the same struggles learning new technology, and
I strongly encourage you get help as often as possible. Steps for
troubleshooting technical problems can often be solved by a quick online
search or reviewing lab materials for a misstep. The class community
discussion on Slack is another resource for help.

## <u>Assignments and Evaluation:</u>

Students will be evaluated based on individual lab assignments,
participation, and team based final project. Students are required to
attend all lectures and labs each week.

### Course Expectations:

UCLA’s Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion provides resources,
events, and information about current initiatives at UCLA to support
equality for all members of the UCLA community. I hope that you will
communicate with me if you experience anything in this course that does
not support an inclusive environment, and you can also report any
incidents you may witness or experience on campus to the Office of
Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion.

I expect you to take advantage of the opportunities that this course
offers you by being an active and thoughtful participant in all sections
and lectures, by coming to lecture and section prepared, and by trying
your best on the various elements of the course. I expect you to take
ownership of your learning and to reach out to me or your teaching
assistant if you are struggling or have concerns. I expect you to take
the opportunity to learn from your peers through activities in lecture
and section, and I expect you to be respectful and courteous to one
another. Finally, I expect you to hold yourself to the highest standards
for academic honesty and integrity in your work.

## Student Resources for Support and Learning

### Providing feedback to me:

I encourage your feedback at any time throughout the quarter about things that are helping you learn or difficult concepts. Please communicate with me if there are ways that we can improve the course to better support student learning.

### Personal Problems: 
I understand that sometimes life makes it difficult to focus on schoolwork. If you are having a personal problem that affects your participation in this course, please talk to me to create a plan. Please do not wait until the end of the quarter to share any challenges that have negatively impacted your engagement and academic performance. The sooner we meet, the more options we will have available able to discuss to support your overall academic success.

### Academic Accommodations Based on a Disability 
Students needing academic accommodations based on a disability should contact the Center for Accessible Education (CAE) at (310)825-1501 or in person at Murphy Hall A255. When possible, students should contact the CAE within the first two weeks of the term as reasonable notice is needed to coordinate accommodations.
