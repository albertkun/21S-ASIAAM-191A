## Lab Assignment #3 - JavaScript FUNctions
### Due 4/22

In this week's lab, we learned how functions are helpful for automating tasks. Functions also form the basis of the programming we will be doing. Your assignment this week is to create a map that will move to certain makers when a button is clicked. 

The requirements are:

- Add at least 3 markers to the map using a [JavaScript function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/Function)
- Use the [`<button>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) to execute a JavaScript function to interact with your map 
- Add an [Event Listener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventListener) that executes the JavaScript function to interact with your map 

### Extra Credit:
- Use something else like images or text to move the map.
- Try something new with the [Leaflet API](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.7.1.html)
