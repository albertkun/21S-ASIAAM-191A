    - [See the update guide for more info](../../Guides/git_fetch_remote_upstream.md)
4. Familiarize yourself with Live Share
    - [See the Live Share guide for more info](../../Guides/live_share.md)
5. Read [Hands On Data Viz - Edit and Host Code with GitHub](https://handsondataviz.org/github.html)
6. Read [The web and web standards](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/The_web_and_web_standards)

### Optional: 
Familiarize yourself with VS Code by:
- Watching this [intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S320N3sxinE) (5 minutes)
- Skimming the [User Interface documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface)


`*` If you already use FireFox as your main browser, consider downloading [FireFox Development Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) or [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html), as it always good practice to have multiple browsers for testing. [See this course reader appendix on troubleshooting as to why](https://handsondataviz.org/fix-browser.html).
