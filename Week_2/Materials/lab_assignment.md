# Lab Assignment - Map Portfolio:
## Due 4/15
Time to put your skills to the test and create a home page for the individual maps that you will be making this quarter. Describe some of your interests and include a map with some markers. This is your portfolio, so feel free to delete or add anything. If you made multiple HTML pages, please link them all to the `index.html` using the `<a href=""></a>` tag>.

Your map portfolio must contain the following:

- A [`<h1>` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) for your title
- Add at least 2-3 markers to the map with a common theme, for example organizations you've volunteered for or places you've traveled.
- A `<h2>` or [`<h3>` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) to create a title for your map. 
- A [`<p>` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p) for a paragraph describing yourself and your goals as a critical digital map maker.
- Style CSS by changing the background color, font, or anything else.
- Use an ordered list [`<ol>` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol) and an unordered list [`<ul>` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul) to list things.
- Include an [`<img>` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) with a photo of yourself or an avatar. Feel free to add other images too to give some flavor to your page, like food or desserts.
- Use the [`<a>` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) to add a link to 2 other web pages.
- Set up GitHub pages for your repo

###  Submission: 
- Commit and publish your file to your repo's [GitHub pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/)
- Find your `index.html` in the `Week_02` folder and copy the URL. It should look something like this:

  - https://albertkun.github.io/21S-ASIAAM-191A-Assignments/Week_02/index.html

- Paste your link as a comment in the [Discussion forum for Lab Assignment #2](https://github.com/albertkun/21S-ASIAAM-191A/discussions/89)


### Extra Credit: (any of these) 
   - Add another `geojson` (it can be `lab1.geojson` or anything else) to a completely different HTML page not `index.html`. (Be sure to link it to your `index.html` and describe what you are showing)
   - Add some Leaflet features that we did not discuss in class.
   - Check out the [Extra](extra.md) or [Leaflet documentation](http://www.leafletjs.com/) and try something there.
